## System Requirements

### Model Requirements

The core functions of CoStrict all depend on large language models, and you need to **prepare the following model services and ensure that the model interfaces are functioning properly**:

```
1. Chat model (providing complete http://chat_model_ip:chat_model_port/v1/chat/completions interface)
2. Embedding model (providing complete http://embedding_model_ip:embedding_model_port/v1/embeddings interface)
3. Rerank model (providing complete http://rerank_model_ip:rerank_model_port/v1/rerank interface)
4. Completion model (providing complete http://completion_model_ip:completion_model_port/v1/completions interface)
```

**Note**: Provide and record accurate `MODEL NAMES`, `APIKEYs`, and `CONTEXT LENGTHS` information. Used for configuration during service deployment.

**Recommended Models** and **Download Addresses**:

- **Chat Model**: `GLM-4.6-FP8`

- **Completion Model**: `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`

- **Embedding Model**: `gte-modernbert-baseRAG/Embedding`

- **Rerank Model**: `gte-reranker-modernbert-baseRAG/Rerank`

- **Download Addresses**:

**Note**: `Code completion`, `vector embedding`, and `rerank` models are for internal use by `CoStrict` only and will not appear in the user-selectable model list.

### 3. Prepare Backend Service Images

CoStrict backend images are mainly stored in the `docker hub` image repository `docker.io/zgsm`.

Before deployment, you need to ensure that the images required for backend deployment can be pulled from the image repository normally.

The images required by CoStrict backend can be found in the `scripts/newest-images.list` file for a complete list.

**If the `scripts/newest-images.list` file does not exist**, you can get this list file from the cloud with the following command.

```bash
bash scripts/get-images-list.sh -o scripts
```

The deployment script will automatically pull all images required for backend deployment during the deployment process.

However, if `the deployment server cannot access the docker hub` image repository, you need to download the images in advance and save them to the specified directory of the deployment machine (assuming saved in /root/images). Then run the following command to preload them.

```bash
bash scripts/load-images.sh -l /root/images
```

In addition to pulling and exporting image files from the docker image repository, you can also download all image files required for CoStrict backend deployment from Baidu Netdisk.

**Netdisk address**:

```
https://pan.baidu.com/s/12kP5VyQinFNrXFsKEWFGJw?pwd=k2dh
```

### 4. Service Deployment

**Note**: Before executing the `automated deployment script` below, please ensure that **checklist items in sections 1.1~2.2 of the [Deployment Checklist](./docs/deploy-checklist.md) have been completed**.

Execute the automated deployment script:

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

The deployment process includes the following steps:

1. Environment check and dependency verification
2. Docker image pulling and building
3. Database initialization
4. Service container startup
5. Health check and status verification

# Nginx configuration example
upstream costrict_backend {
    server {COSTRICT_BACKEND}:{PORT_APISIX_ENTRY};
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://costrict_backend;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
